HTML (25%)
    1/5:
    Basic HTML structure is present.

        Can be found in any html file. Have a look at the index.html for example


    2/5:
    HTML structure with clear content differentiation (headings, paragraphs, lists).

        This can also be found in any html.file. Refer to the index.html again.

    3/5:
    Use of forms, links, and media.
    
        Form can be found in the quiz.html
        Links can be seen in portfolio.html
        Media you can find on gallery.html

    4/5:
    Tables are effectively used.
    
        You can find tables in portfolio.html. Refer to the skills or project sections.


    5/5:
    Consistent use of semantic HTML throughout, ensuring better structure and understanding of the content.
    
        There are <section> elements used in portfolio.html 
        The <main> element is used in every html file beginning right after the <header> and closing right before the <footer>.
        You can also find <header> and <footer> elements in every html file.
        The <nav> elements you can find in the <header>

CSS (25%)

    All the styling can be found in the styles.css file.

    1/5:
    Basic CSS styling (colors, fonts).
    
        The header and footer have both color and font styling. Both have a black background-color property. Footer has different font as well as fallback fonts.
        Font color has been changed in footer and header and I have assigned a different background-color to the body-element.

    2/5:
    Use of classes and IDs to style specific elements.

        Classes can be found in any html.file. IDs can be found all over the place but look at the portfolio.html and find the "About" section and there is an ID right there (also a few classes too).


    3/5:
    Implementation of responsive design elements.
    
        Have a look at the gallery.html and portfolio.html. At the bottom of the styles.css you can see the how the flex-direction changes depending on the screen width. You can see it using the developer tools for example. In the portfolio the "About me" paragraph changes place depending on the screen width. On a monitor it shows next to the profile picture and on mobile it shows below the picture.

        In the gallery page you can see how the images change size too if the screen size becomes smaller.

    4/5:
    Use of layouts for advanced user interfaces (arrays, float, flexbox, css grid)

        portfolio.html has the Grid layout. Refer to the styles.css on the line 210.
        The <body> tag on line 3 of the styles.css has been made a flex-container.

    5/5:
    Styling demonstrates a strong grasp of layout principles, aesthetics, and user experience.

        There is a lot of styling. If you want to look at something specific, look at the gallery.html. The styling for the stuff inside can be found in the styles.css on the lines 89-182. 

JavaScript Basics (25%)

    1/5:
    Simple interactions (like alerts on button click).
    
        An alert has been placed at the bottom of the index.html. It checks if you have visited before and if you haven't it will give you a welcome message in a pop-up window for the first time you visit the page.

    2/5:
    Multiple event listeners and basic DOM manipulations.
    
        In the script.js you can find event listeners for all the arrow keys used in the gallery.html file.

    3/5:

    Use of arrays, objects, and functions.
    Learn about Arrays
    Learn about Objects
    Learn about Functions

        Once again in the gallery.html there are lots of pictures and paragraphs, that I have put into an array in the script.js.

        In the about.html page you can find a table containing information about my cat. In the bottom of the script.js you will see that I've made an object of my cat and in the about.html I call the right value using a specific id.

        The alert you saw before has a function I described earlier. Also in the gallery.html I have functions that check which picture and paragraph will be shown. Refer to the script.js on the lines 10-21 for the example.

    4/5:
    Advanced logic, looping through data, and dynamic DOM updates.
    
        You've already seen looping through data in the gallery.html. In the script we use ForEach method to loop through the data.

        

    5/5:

    Consistent use of Object-Oriented JavaScript principles.
    Learn about Constructors

Asynchronous Operations (25%)

    1/5:

    Use of timers.
    Learn about Timers
    2/5:

    Successful implementation of an AJAX call or Fetch.
    Learn about AJAX
    Learn about Fetch
    Learn about Fetch more..
    3/5:

    Data from the asynchronous call is displayed on the webpage.
    4/5:

    Error handling is implemented (for failed API calls, etc.).
    Learn about JS Error Handling
    5/5:

    Effective use of asynchronous data to enhance user experience (like filtering, sorting).
